## Overview

I am technologist forged in the golden era of Sybase.

As a Senior IT Consultant with 30+ years of hands-on experience in enterprise database administration and technical project management, I'm interested in exploring the latest SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) 16.1 

I've created this public repository to consider SAP ASE CORE TROUBLESHOOTING SKILLS and ongoing practical day to day DBA tasks, performance and tuning, backup/restore, and monitoring among many others.
I've an extensive collection of enlightening AI prompts that helped me to solve complex AWS DevOps tasks. I'm sure my prompt engineering skills would soon allow me to GIT version control and structure this repository    

I am currently charging forward into the modern AI Agents + AI DevOps frontier, eager to tackle and solve the still ASE DB day to day database administration challenges, like :

1. Slow transactions
 - High transaction loading times and overall slowness
 - Investigating and resolving issues related to work processes (e.g., processes stuck in a stopped or cancelled state)
2. Resource contention
  - Disk I/O wait times, memory limitations, CPU limitations, and contention for resources impacting performance
3. Monitoring and analysis
- Overall system performance (response time, throughput, system waits)
- AI Agents SQL command execution plans analysis
4. Tuning database darameters
- Maintaining and adjusting database parameters to optimize performance
5. Space management
- To ensure sufficient space for data and logs 
- Space usage monitoring to regularly check the amount of space left and anticipate potential issues
- CAPACITY STORAGE SPACE PLANNIG supported by AI agents 
- AI Agents automatically extending tablespaces or transaction log space
6. Backup and recovery
- AI Agents HA and DR enabled  
- Database backups intelligent management for data protection
7. User and general security management
- User creation, modification, user accounts permissions boundaries
- Implementing and maintaining database security measures
8. Troubleshooting connection issues
- when users cannot connect to the database
9. Error analysis
- database logs analysis and other system logs analysis to identify the root cause of issues 
10. High availability and database replication
- Configuring and maintaining high availability solutions and replication setups
