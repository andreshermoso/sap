## About me

I am a technologist forged in the golden era of Sybase — a senior IT consultant with over 30 years of hands-on experience in enterprise database administration and technical project management.

My current interests include exploring the latest capabilities of SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) 16.1, along with SAP IQ, SAP Replication Server, SAP SQL Anywhere, and SAP PowerDesigner.

### repo v.1.0
This public repository first version was meant to explore core SAP ASE troubleshooting skills and essential daily DBA tasks, including

1. [Slow transactions](#slowtransactions)
 - High transaction loading times and overall slowness
 - Investigating and resolving issues related to work processes (e.g., processes stuck in a stopped or cancelled state)
2. [Resource contention](#resourcecontention)
  - Disk I/O wait times, memory limitations, CPU limitations, and contention for resources impacting performance
3. [Monitoring and analysis](#monitoringandanalysis)
- Overall system performance (response time, throughput, system waits)
- AI Agents SQL command execution plans analysis
4. [Tuning database parameters](#tuningdatabaseparameters)
- Maintaining and adjusting database parameters to optimize performance
5. [Space management](#spacemanagement)
- To ensure sufficient space for data and logs 
- Space usage monitoring to regularly check the amount of space left and anticipate potential issues
- CAPACITY STORAGE SPACE PLANNIG supported by AI agents 
- AI Agents automatically extending tablespaces or transaction log space
6. [Backup and recovery](#backupandrecovery)

... And many other practical, real-world activities

I’ve also compiled an extensive set of AI-generated prompts that have helped me solve complex AWS DevOps challenges. These experiences have sharpened my prompt engineering skills, which I believe will soon enhance how I structure and version-control this repository using Git more effectively.

Currently, I’m diving into the emerging intersection of AI Agents and DevOps, while continuing to address the ongoing day-to-day challenges of ASE database administration.

This repository is a work in progress. As I continue exploring the latest technical and functional updates of ASE, IQ, RS, SQLA and PowerDesigner, I ask for your patience while I refine and version-control useful AI-assisted scripts.
